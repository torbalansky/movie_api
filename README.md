### Welcome to Movie_API

This REST API serves as the communication bridge between myFlix frontend applications (React and Angular) and the MongoDB Database. It facilitates the retrieval of movie data from the database and delivers it to the frontend in response to relevant requests.

Users can perform various actions, including registration, login, accessing movie details, adding movies to their favorites, editing user information, and deleting their accounts.
